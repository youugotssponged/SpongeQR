**SpongeQR** is a **C#.NET WPF** based **Windows Application** that i'm currently developing based on the idea of creating a simple to use tool that freely allows
individuals, freelancers, small businesses and startups generate their own **QR Codes** easily from a single lightweight application.

Source and Application are under the [**MIT Licence**](https://github.com/youugotssponged/SpongeQR/blob/main/LICENSE), so it's completely free!

_Due to the current events with COVID-19, i thought this would be a neat little tool to help towards the transition of 
businesses utilising online methods of advertising and providing their services._

### Special Thanks to:
Throughout developing this application, i utilised the QRCoder Library developed by **Raffael Herrmann (@codebude)** extensively, 
from this i learned a lot more than i already knew about QR Codes and how they are generated. 
Below is a link to his repo which also houses the wonderfully written documentation which makes putting together QR Codes so simple and effective.
