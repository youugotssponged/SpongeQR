# SpongeQR

## SpongeQR is a C#.net WPF based Windows Application that i'm currently developing based on the ideas of:
- Current Events (such as COVID and many startups being affected by this)
- To create a simple to use generator tool to allow businesses, startups and individuals to promote themselves. 
- To further my own self learning.

# This was built using:
- C#, WPF
- QRCoder Library from Raffael Herrmann (codebude) -> [Download Here](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder)
